Welcome to DSA-Approaches!  
This repository focuses on solving algorithmic problems by organizing them based on common approaches and techniques such as Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, etc.

Structure:  
- Each approach has its own folder (e.g., TwoPointers/)  
- Inside each approach folder, each problem is stored in a separate folder named by question number or title (e.g., 123_TwoSum/)  
- Every problem folder contains:  
  - Source code files  
  - Video explanations  
  - Diagrams or images that visually explain the problem or solution

This format helps you learn how different techniques are applied across various problems with clear, visual, and coded examples.
